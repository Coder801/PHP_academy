            <b>A hope of leaves and hollows,
            a breaking nest, a crest of graniteand unquarried moss.</b>
            It’s soft wintering a shade between green
            and gray.
            <b>The hope of colors for
            which there is no word develops and
            then fades. </b>
            Uncaptured and un-impressed
            in a kind of precision in dissolution.
            Or in silence and the desire to trespass
            and hold where the roots’ incision splits. Some
            inevitable gesture or quantity in monochrome
            and grateful light. And still the distance
            between tongue and sight contained
            in each body and measured as a factor
            of attempt. Approach. Carefully mantained
            first to shimmer and then break at the horizon.
            Where the eye seeks motion, a threshing up
            or fluttering, or blurring of wings and leaves.
